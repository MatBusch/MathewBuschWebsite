                    <p>We ran a test that consisted of a redesigned banner area with a modal form attached. Users
                        could then interact with this new form to be more informed about what type of business
                        insurance
                        they needed before being taken to the quote funnel.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Brief</h2>

                    <p>The brief was simply to run a test in the attempt to increase sales of Business Insurance. Due
                        to the
                        nature of this, the opportunity to test a new CTA was taken advantage of during our design
                        process.</br>
                        </br>
                        Before beginning with sketching or wireframing we were tasked with creating a matrix of
                        possible Business
                        Insurance types a user could qualify for, based on a set of questions they were to fill out in
                        a
                        form.
                        <br>
                        Once we had established the flow mapping, we began our work in Sketch where we started by
                        redesigning the banner area. By moving content to the left of the image we created a pattern
                        that could be repeated accross all product pages site wide and has now started to be
                        implemented (image above).
                        It had been raised that the lead designer for AAMI was looking to left align as much as
                        possible elseware on the site, so in an attmept to reduce the amount of change required later
                        we
                        tackled the
                        challenge of desifgning the product page banner now, rather than just throwing in the modal
                        experience on a generic CTA.
                    </p>


                    <p>The images below display one of the possible tracks of the modal flow starting after clicking
                        the
                        new
                        CTA on the product page. Also a note that these modals needed to follow styleguide
                        specifications in order for it to be built by the in house Content Team if this test was deemed
                        to be
                        successful.</p>
